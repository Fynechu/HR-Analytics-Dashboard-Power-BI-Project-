Description
This is a personal portfolio project built using Power BI to transform raw HR data into actionable insights. The report features interactive visuals designed for HR leaders and decision-makers to understand employee attrition, satisfaction levels, and trends in career progression.
Business Introduction
Organisations are increasingly relying on data to retain talent, enhance work environments, and optimise workforce planning. HR analytics is a vital tool for analysing employee trends, predicting attrition, and aligning HR strategies with business goals.
Business Problem
High employee turnover can negatively impact productivity, morale, and cost-efficiency. Many HR teams struggle with understanding:
•	Where attrition is highest
•	Which departments need intervention
•	How employee satisfaction varies across roles and tenure levels
